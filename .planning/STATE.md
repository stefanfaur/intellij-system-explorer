## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Architecture: TransferHandler for drag-out, DnDNativeTarget for drops — do not mix the two DnD systems
- Architecture: Use com.intellij.diff.* exclusively (not deprecated com.intellij.openapi.diff.*)
- Architecture: All Git CLI calls must run off EDT via executeOnPooledThread or Task.Backgroundable

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 planning: Dirty-tree smart checkout UX needs validation against IntelliJ's own checkout flow before designing the dialog
- Phase 6 planning: git stash --include-untracked behavior on SSH/remote repos needs live validation before planning
- General: 2025.3 threading model (Write-Intent lock removal from AWT input events) may affect existing LocalGitBackend callsites — validate against 2025.3 EAP before release
